# Kandesk

Kandesk is a simple trello-like app that I created for my own needs and for learning elixir & liveview. It has a simple set of features. I use it every day (hosting it on a small raspberry pi3) and it is suitable for individuals or small teams.

## Installation & requirements

[Elixir 1.12+](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) is required to run Kandesk.

Node.js 25 or newer.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`


## Create a first admin user

To be able to connect to the application, a first admin user must be created.
This is done by running:

    mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs

Then you can connect with "admin@admin.com" as Email and "admin" as Password. Then you will be able to change everything from within the application, password included ;-)

## Avatars

Avatars are currently saved to disk at "/srv/www/kandesk". You need to create this directory with the required rights to be able to save & use avatars with your installation.


## Access the application

Now you can visit [`localhost:4001`](http://localhost:4001) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
